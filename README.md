  The core of the analysis is built around the company's balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement, with data compared across multiple years. Various financial ratios are applied to assess different aspects of the business. Liquidity ratios such as the current and quick ratios indicate the company’s ability to meet short-term obligations, while profitability ratios like net profit margin, return on assets (ROA), and return on equity (ROE) help evaluate its earnings performance. Additionally, activity ratios such as inventory turnover and debtor turnover are used to assess operational efficiency, and leverage ratios like debt-to-equity and interest coverage ratios examine the company’s long-term financial risk.
  Trend analysis is employed to observe the financial trajectory of the company over time, and both comparative and common-size analyses are used to provide deeper insights by standardizing the financial data. The findings suggest that Dabur India Ltd maintains strong liquidity, has shown consistent growth in revenue and profitability, and efficiently manages its assets. The company also maintains low debt levels, indicating a strong and stable financial structure. In conclusion, Dabur India Ltd appears to be financially sound with a strong market presence, making it a well-managed and sustainable business.
